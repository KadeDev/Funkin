> Uh oh! Your tryin to kiss ur hot girlfriend, but her MEAN and EVIL dad is trying to KILL you! He's an ex-rockstar, the only way to get to his heart? The power of music...

## Cappy's Mix

Cappy's Mix is a mod for Friday Night Funkin' based on the Kade Engine code.

Links: **[play in browser](https://fnf-cappy-mix.github.io/FNF-Cappy-Mix/)** (More coming soon)

**REMEMBER**: This is a **mod**. This is not the vanilla game and should be treated as a **modification**. This is not and probably will never be official, so don't get confused.

#
Features

* A new remixed soundtrack by Cappy Ishihara! (coming soon)
* A new, optimized code based on the Kade Engine!
